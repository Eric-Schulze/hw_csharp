K-Means Assignment:
By adding attribute names to the global list variable, we can control how many and which attributes are used
in the k-means calculations. Here are the tested combinations with the accuracies:

 Attributes								Accuracy
------------				       			       ----------
petal_length								95.3%

petal_width								96%

sepal_length								66.7%

sepal_width								14%

petal_length, petal_width						96%

sepal_length, sepal_width						81.3%

petal_length, petal_width, sepal_length					90.7%

petal_length, petal_width, sepal_width					95.3%

sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length					88%

sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_width					82.7%

petal_length, petal_width, sepal_length, sepal_width			89.3%
